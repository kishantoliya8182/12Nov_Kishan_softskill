Dear krupal,

I hope you are doing well. I wanted to take a moment to thank you for your support during my U.S. visa process.
Your guidance and help made the entire process much easier for me.
From explaining the steps to helping with the documentation, I really appreciate the time and effort you put in to everything smoothly.
Because of your help, I felt more confident and prepared at every stage.
I cannot thank you enough for your kindness and patience throughout this time.
If there’s anything I can do to return the favor, please feel free to let me know.
Once again, thank you for being so helpful and supportive.


Thank you,
Kishan Toliya
